- Supports both CLI and programmatic usage
- Error handling with informative messages

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Make sure the virtual environment is activated first, then:

```bash
python download_model.py <repo_id> <local_dir>
```

Example:
```bash
# Activate environment if not already activated
source /home/aloha/act/bin/activate

# Run the script
python hf_model_download.py mobilealohafalkenberg/toast_25_150_2000_1e5_16 /home/aloha/models/toast
# or, for any other model repo
python hf_model_download.py mobilealohafalkenberg/sort_garbage /home/aloha/models/sort_garbage
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
# Make sure to run this in the activated virtual environment
from hf_model_download import download_model

# Download a model
downloaded_path = download_model(
    repo_id="mobilealohafalkenberg/toast_25_150_2000_1e5_16",
    local_dir="/home/aloha/models/toast"
)
```

## Parameters

## Virtual Environment

This project uses a Python virtual environment named "act" located at `/home/aloha/act`. Always ensure you're working within this environment:

```bash
# Check if you're in the correct environment
which python
# Should show: /home/aloha/act/bin/python

# If not in the environment, activate it
source /home/aloha/act/bin/activate
```

To deactivate the environment when you're done:
```bash
deactivate
```
